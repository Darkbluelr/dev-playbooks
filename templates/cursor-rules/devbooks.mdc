When the request involves proposal/spec/change/plan or architecture/external contract changes:

1) Read `AGENTS.md` first and follow DevBooks protocol discovery and constraints.
2) Default to English output.
3) Enforce role isolation: Test Owner and Coder must be in separate sessions; Coder must not modify `tests/`.
