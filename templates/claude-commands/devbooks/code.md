# /devbooks:code

Triggers Skill: `devbooks-coder`

## Purpose

Act as Coder: implement strictly per `tasks.md` and run quality gates; do not modify `tests/`; completion is defined by tests/static checks only.

## Typical use cases

- Implement per plan
- Fix failing tests and make gates green
- Resume from checkpoints (detect completed tasks automatically)

Explicitly use `devbooks-coder` to execute the workflow.
