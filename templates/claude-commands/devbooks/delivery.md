Triggers Skill: `devbooks-delivery-workflow`

## Purpose

Run a change as a traceable closed loop (Design → Plan → Trace → Verify → Implement → Archive), with explicit DoD, traceability matrix, and role isolation.

## Typical use cases

- You need an end-to-end delivery/acceptance workflow
- Generate traceability matrix and DoD checks
- Ensure the change package meets archive readiness criteria

Explicitly use `devbooks-delivery-workflow` to execute the workflow.
