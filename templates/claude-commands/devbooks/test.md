# /devbooks:test

Triggers Skill: `devbooks-test-owner`

## Purpose

Act as Test Owner: convert design/spec into executable acceptance tests and a traceability doc (`verification.md`), staying isolated from implementation and producing a Red baseline first.

## Typical use cases

- Generate tests from specs
- Build a traceability matrix (AC to tests)
- Produce Red/Green baseline evidence

Explicitly use `devbooks-test-owner` to execute the workflow.
