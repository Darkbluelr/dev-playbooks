# DevBooks: Router

Use Router to detect the current status and output the shortest closed-loop routing plan.

## Usage

/devbooks:router [args]

## Args

$ARGUMENTS

## Notes

Router is the main entry guide for non-trivial changes (multi-file or cross-module):
- Detects the current phase based on existing artifacts
- Recommends the next Skill and the exact artifact paths

If you already know the specific Skill to run, use the direct command. If unsure, prefer `/devbooks:start`.
