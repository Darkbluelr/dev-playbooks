# /devbooks:plan

Triggers Skill: `devbooks-implementation-plan`

## Purpose

Derive an implementation plan (`tasks.md`) from the design doc: critical path, side quests, checkpoints, and verification anchors.

## Typical use cases

- Break down work after design is complete
- Create trackable milestones and verification anchors
- Plan parallel vs sequential task dependencies

Explicitly use `devbooks-implementation-plan` to execute the workflow.
