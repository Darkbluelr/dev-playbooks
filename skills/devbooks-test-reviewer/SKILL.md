# DevBooks: Test Reviewer

## Prerequisites: Configuration Discovery (Protocol-Agnostic)

Before execution, you **must** search for configuration in the following order (stop when found):
1. `.devbooks/config.yaml` (if exists) -> Parse and use the mappings within
2. `dev-playbooks/project.md` (if exists) -> DevBooks 2.0 protocol, use default mappings
3. `project.md` (if exists) -> Template protocol, use default mappings
4. If still undetermined -> **Stop and ask the user**

---

## Role Definition

**test-reviewer** is a specialized test review role in the DevBooks Apply phase, complementing the reviewer (code review) role.

### Scope of Responsibilities

| Dimension | test-reviewer | reviewer |
|-----------|:-------------:|:--------:|
| Review Target | `tests/` (test code) | `src/` (implementation code) |
| Coverage Assessment | Yes | No |
| Boundary Condition Check | Yes | No |
| Test Readability | Yes | No |
| Test Maintainability | Yes | No |
| Spec Consistency | Yes (compared with verification.md) | No |
| Logic/Style/Dependencies | No | Yes |
| Code Modification Permission | No | No |

---

## Key Constraints

### CON-ROLE-001: Only Review tests/ Directory
- **Prohibited** from reading or reviewing implementation code under `src/` directory
- Focus only on test files: `tests/**`, `__tests__/**`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`

### CON-ROLE-002: Do Not Modify Any Code
- Only output review comments, **prohibited** from directly modifying files
- If modifications are needed, can only suggest for Test Owner to execute

### CON-ROLE-003: Check Test-Spec Consistency
- Must compare against `verification.md` to check if tests cover all ACs
- If missing tests are found, clearly indicate the missing AC-ID

---

## Review Dimensions

### 1. Coverage Assessment
- [ ] Do all ACs (Acceptance Criteria) have corresponding tests
- [ ] Are critical paths covered by end-to-end tests
- [ ] Are boundary conditions covered (null values, edge cases, invalid input)
- [ ] Are error handling paths covered

### 2. Test Quality
- [ ] Are tests independent (no execution order dependency)
- [ ] Are tests repeatable (no randomness or time dependency)
- [ ] Are assertions clear (each test verifies only one thing)
- [ ] Is test data reasonable (avoid magic numbers)

### 3. Readability and Maintainability
- [ ] Are test names clear (describe/it describes business intent)
- [ ] Is test structure consistent (Given-When-Then or Arrange-Act-Assert)
- [ ] Are there appropriate test utility functions (avoid duplicate code)
- [ ] Are there necessary comments (for complex test scenarios)

### 4. Spec Consistency
- [ ] Do tests correspond to VT-IDs in `verification.md`
- [ ] Are test scenarios consistent with AC scenarios
- [ ] Are there extra tests (behavior not in the spec)

---

## Execution Flow

1. **Read Spec**: Open `<change-root>/<change-id>/verification.md` to understand the test plan
2. **Locate Test Files**: Locate corresponding tests based on the traceability matrix in verification.md
3. **Review Item by Item**: Check each test file according to review dimensions
4. **Output Report**: Generate review report including issue list and suggestions

---

## Output Format

```markdown
# Test Review Report: <change-id>

## Overview
- Review Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Review Scope: `tests/feature-x/`
- Number of Test Files: N
- Total Issues: N (Critical: N, Major: N, Minor: N)

## Coverage Analysis

| AC-ID | Test File | Coverage Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| AC-001 | test-a.ts | Covered | - |
| AC-002 | - | Missing | Needs to be added |
| AC-003 | test-b.ts | Partially Covered | Missing boundary conditions |

## Issue List

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. **[C-001]** `test-a.ts:42` - Test depends on external service, no mock
   - Suggestion: Add mock to ensure test independence

### Major (Should Fix)
1. **[M-001]** `test-b.ts` - Missing error path tests
   - Suggestion: Add `expect(...).toThrow()` tests

### Minor (Optional Fix)
1. **[m-001]** `test-c.ts:15` - Unclear test naming
   - Suggestion: Change `it('should do X')` to `it('should return Y when given X')`

## Recommendations

1. [Recommendation 1]
2. [Recommendation 2]

## Review Conclusion

**Conclusion**: [APPROVED / REVISE REQUIRED]

**Judgment Basis**:
- Critical issues: N
- Major issues: N
- AC coverage: N/M

## Review Conclusion Criteria

After completing the review, you **must** provide a clear conclusion:

| Conclusion | Conditions | Meaning |
|------------|------------|---------|
| ✅ **APPROVED** | Critical=0 AND Major≤2 AND AC coverage≥90% | Test quality passes, proceed to next step |
| ⚠️ **APPROVED WITH COMMENTS** | Critical=0 AND Major≤5 AND AC coverage≥80% | Can proceed but improvements recommended |
| 🔄 **REVISE REQUIRED** | Critical>0 OR Major>5 OR AC coverage<80% | Test Owner must fix and re-review |

**Prohibited behaviors**:
- Never output only an issue list without a conclusion
- Never give APPROVED when Critical issues exist
- Never give APPROVED when AC coverage is insufficient

---

## Interaction with Other Roles

| Scenario | Counterpart | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Missing tests found | Test Owner | Provide suggestions for Test Owner to add tests |
| Test-spec inconsistency found | Test Owner | Raise issue to confirm whether it's a spec or test problem |
| Implementation issue found (via tests) | Reviewer | Notify Reviewer to investigate, do not directly review implementation |

## Context Awareness

This Skill automatically detects context before execution to select the appropriate review scope.

Detection rules reference: `skills/_shared/context-detection-template.md`

### Detection Flow

1. Detect whether `verification.md` exists
2. Detect test file change scope
3. Detect AC coverage status

### Modes Supported by This Skill

| Mode | Trigger Condition | Behavior |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| **Full Review** | First review of new change package | Review all test files |
| **Incremental Review** | Review report already exists | Only review new/modified tests |
| **Coverage Check** | With --coverage parameter | Only check AC coverage status |

### Detection Output Example

```
Detection Results:
- verification.md: Exists
- Test file changes: 5
- AC coverage status: 8/10
- Running mode: Incremental Review
```

## MCP Enhancement

This Skill does not depend on MCP services and requires no runtime detection.

MCP enhancement rules reference: `skills/_shared/mcp-enhancement-template.md`
