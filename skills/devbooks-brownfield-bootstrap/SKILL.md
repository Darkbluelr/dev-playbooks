# DevBooks: Brownfield Bootstrap

## Prerequisites: Configuration Discovery (Protocol Agnostic)

- `<truth-root>`: Current truth directory root
- `<change-root>`: Change package directory root
- `<devbooks-root>`: DevBooks management directory (usually `dev-playbooks/`)

Before execution, **must** search for configuration in the following order (stop when found):
1. `.devbooks/config.yaml` (if exists) → Parse and use its mappings
2. `dev-playbooks/project.md` (if exists) → Dev-Playbooks protocol, use default mappings
3. `project.md` (if exists) → Template protocol, use default mappings
5. If still unable to determine → **Create DevBooks directory structure and initialize basic configuration**

**Key Constraints**:
- If configuration specifies `agents_doc` (rules document), **must read that document first** before executing any operations
- Do not guess directory roots
- Do not skip reading rules document

## Core Responsibilities

Brownfield project initialization includes the following responsibilities:

### 1. Basic Configuration File Initialization

Check and create in `<devbooks-root>/` (usually `dev-playbooks/`):

| File | Purpose | Creation Condition |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `constitution.md` | Project constitution (GIP principles) | When file doesn't exist |
| `project.md` | Project context (tech stack/conventions) | When file doesn't exist |

**Creation Method**:
- **Not simple template copying**, but customized content based on code analysis results
- `constitution.md`: Based on default GIP principles, can be adjusted according to project characteristics
- `project.md`: Filled based on code analysis results:
  - Tech stack (language/framework/database)
  - Development conventions (code style/testing strategy/Git workflow)
  - Domain context (core concepts/role definitions)
  - Directory root mappings

### 2. Project Profile and Metadata

Generate in `<truth-root>/_meta/`:

| Artifact | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Project profile | `_meta/project-profile.md` | Detailed technical profile with three-layer architecture |
| Glossary | `_meta/glossary.md` | Unified language table (optional but recommended) |
| Documentation maintenance metadata | `_meta/docs-maintenance.md` | Documentation style and maintenance configuration |
| Domain concepts | `_meta/key-concepts.md` | Concept extraction based on code semantics (optional) |

### 2.5 Project SSOT (must create when upstream SSOT is absent)

To solve “SSOT is huge + changes often → humans can’t reliably tell what’s done vs not done”, this skill MUST scaffold a **minimal, addressable Project SSOT pack** when the project does not have an upstream SSOT library:

| Artifact | Path (relative to `<truth-root>`) | Description |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Project SSOT | `ssot/SSOT.md` | Human-readable system truth skeleton (requirements/contracts/ops constraints/open questions) |
| Requirements Set (machine-readable) | `ssot/requirements.index.yaml` | Stable ID → anchor → statement; used by `upstream_claims` and archive adjudication |
| Requirements Ledger (derived cache) | `ssot/requirements.ledger.yaml` | Progress view; safe to delete and regenerate (derived from archived change packages) |

If the project already has an upstream SSOT (e.g., a separate `SSOT docs/` folder), do **not** copy long documents. Instead, keep pointers/links in `ssot/SSOT.md` and establish stable IDs + anchors in `requirements.index.yaml`.

### 3. Architecture Analysis Artifacts

Generate in `<truth-root>/architecture/`:

| Artifact | Path | Data Source |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **C4 Architecture Map** | `architecture/c4.md` | Comprehensive analysis (optionally with structured capability) |
| Module dependency graph | `architecture/module-graph.md` | Structured dependency analysis (optional) |
| Technical debt hotspots | `architecture/hotspots.md` | Change history + complexity analysis (optional) |
| Layering constraints | `architecture/layering-constraints.md` | Code analysis (optional) |

> **Design Decision**: C4 architecture map is now generated by brownfield-bootstrap during initialization. Subsequent architecture changes are recorded in design.md's Architecture Impact section and merged by archiver during archiving.

### 4. Baseline Change Package

Generate in `<change-root>/<baseline-id>/`:

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `proposal.md` | Baseline scope, In/Out, risks |
| `design.md` | Current state inventory (capability inventory) |
| `specs/<cap>/spec.md` | Baseline spec deltas (mainly ADDED) |
| `verification.md` | Minimum verification anchor plan |

---

## COD Model Generation (Code Overview & Dependencies)

Optionally generate the project's "code map" during initialization, based on available structured code analysis capability:

### Auto-generated Artifacts

| Artifact | Path | Data Source |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **C4 Architecture Map** | `<truth-root>/architecture/c4.md` | Comprehensive analysis |
| Module dependency graph | `<truth-root>/architecture/module-graph.md` | Structured dependency analysis (optional) |
| Technical debt hotspots | `<truth-root>/architecture/hotspots.md` | Change history + complexity analysis (optional) |
| Domain concepts | `<truth-root>/_meta/key-concepts.md` | Code semantic concept extraction (optional) |
| Project profile | `<truth-root>/_meta/project-profile.md` | Comprehensive analysis |

### C4 Architecture Map Generation Rules

C4 map generated during initialization should include:

1. **Context Level**: System's relationship with external actors (users, external systems)
2. **Container Level**: Containers within the system (applications, databases, services)
3. **Component Level**: Components within main containers (modules, classes)

**Output Format**:

```markdown
# C4 Architecture Map

## System Context

[Describe system boundaries and external interactions]

## Container Diagram

| Container | Tech Stack | Responsibility |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| <name> | <tech> | <responsibility> |

## Component Diagram

### <Container Name>

| Component | Responsibility | Dependencies |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| <name> | <responsibility> | <dependencies> |

## Architecture Guardrails

### Layering Constraints

| Layer | Can Depend On | Cannot Depend On |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| <layer> | <allowed> | <forbidden> |
```

### Hotspot Calculation Formula

```
Hotspot Score = Change Frequency × Cyclomatic Complexity
```

- **High Hotspot** (score > threshold): Frequent changes + high complexity = Bug-dense area
- **Dormant Debt** (high complexity + low frequency): Temporarily safe but needs attention
- **Active Healthy** (high frequency + low complexity): Normal maintenance area

### Boundary Identification

Automatically distinguish:
- **User Code**: `src/`, `lib/`, `app/` etc. (modifiable)
- **Library Code**: `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `.venv/` etc. (immutable interface)
- **Generated Code**: `dist/`, `build/`, `*.generated.*` etc. (manual modification prohibited)

### Execution Flow

1) **Check available capability**: confirm structured code analysis capability (such as dependency or reference tracking).
2) **Generate COD artifacts**: use available code search, reference tracking, and change history analysis to produce dependency graphs, hotspots, and concepts.
3) **Generate project profile**: integrate the above data with traditional analysis.

## Reference Scaffolds and Templates

- Workflow: `references/brownfield-bootstrap.md`
- Code navigation strategy: `references/code-navigation-strategy.md`
- **Project profile template (three-layer architecture)**: `templates/project-profile-template-project-profile.md`
- One-time prompt: `references/brownfield-bootstrap-prompt.md`
- Template (as needed): `references/glossary-template.md`

---

## Context Awareness

This Skill automatically detects context before execution and selects the appropriate initialization scope.

Detection rules reference: `skills/_shared/context-detection-template-context-detection.md`

### Detection Flow

1. Detect if `<devbooks-root>/constitution.md` exists
2. Detect if `<devbooks-root>/project.md` exists
3. Detect if `<truth-root>/` is empty or basically empty
4. Detect whether structured analysis capability is available
5. Detect project scale and language stack

### Modes Supported by This Skill

| Mode | Trigger Condition | Behavior |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| **Full New Init** | devbooks-root doesn't exist or is empty | Create complete directory structure + constitution + project + profile |
| **Supplement Config** | constitution/project missing | Only supplement missing configuration files |
| **Complete Init** | truth-root is empty | Generate all basic artifacts (profile/baseline/verification) |
| **Incremental Init** | truth-root partially exists | Only supplement missing artifacts |
| **Structured Analysis** | Structured capability available | Use dependency/reference tracking to refine the profile |
| **Text Analysis** | Only text search available | Use traditional analysis methods |

### Detection Output Example

```
Detection Results:
- devbooks-root: Exists
- constitution.md: Doesn't exist → Will create
- project.md: Doesn't exist → Will create
- truth-root: Empty
- Structured capability: Available
- Project scale: Medium (~50K LOC)
- Running mode: Supplement Config + Complete Init + Structured Analysis
```
